## Bioinformatics for T cell immunologists - ENLIGHTEN course 2022

Our course requires basic R and Python understanding, to follow up specific analysis tutorials. We recommend all participants to acquire/brush up their basic skills in these languages.

You do not have to be fluent in either language - but it will be very useful if you  come to the workshops with some knowledge, maybe with some questions arisen when going through the materials. We have a 2h practical at the beginning of the course for R/Python, let's make the most of it!

 Please go through `R_intro/Readme.md` and `Python_intro/intro_to_python.ipynb` and check whether you are familiar with the concepts mentioned. We also give there further suggestions about learning R/Python.
 
 For R, the directory `working_dir/analysis` contains short practicals for introduction to basic R (1_R_Intro.Rmd) and to tidyverse(2_R_tidyverse.Rmd) - consider going through them too.

All the best and see you in Hinxton!
